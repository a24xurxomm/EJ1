    <h1>My favorite mammal</h1>
    <h2>Dolphin</h2>
    <p>The <strong>dolphin</strong> is a <em>marine mammal</em> known for its intelligence, social behavior, and
        agility. It has a streamlined body with smooth, gray skin and a dorsal fin that helps it swim at high speeds.
        Dolphins communicate with each other through a series of clicks and whistles, and they are known for their
        playful nature and ability to interact with humans. They live in groups called pods and feed on fish and squid,
        using echolocation to detect their prey.</p>
